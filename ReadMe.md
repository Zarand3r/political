Make a nested parser for the Leip data start here https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2004&f=0&off=0&elect=0
Prototype uses the surprise library SVD (try the SVDpp too)
For time SVD++, take inspiration from here https://github.com/leo1023/timeSVDpp_librec_based/blob/master/timeSVDpp.py
